# dolphin-emu-installer-for-chrome-os
this is a remake of the offical way to install dolphin emulator. (https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/guides/building-dolphin-linux/) this code was made by Totsugeki


please ensure that you have "cmake" and "make" installed.
if the installation fails, install cmake and make and try again.
I only tried this on chromeos, it might work on debian and unbuntu, not sure.


how to run:

1. move "dolphin-installer-chromeos.sh" to Linux Files.
2. run these commands:

chmod +x dolphin-installer-chromeos.sh

./dolphin-installer-chromeos.sh


4. wait for installer to finish. please do check on it now and then to see if any errors occured.
